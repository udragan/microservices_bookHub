Project Title: "BookHub" ‚Äì A Microservices-based Book Store

üß© Overview
"BookHub" is an online book store where users can browse books, purchase them, and leave reviews. It includes:
- User authentication
- Book catalog
- Order processing
- Reviews
- Payment (mocked)
- Notifications

üß± Microservices Breakdown
Service Name	        Responsibilities	                              Communication
Auth Service	        User registration, login (JWT), role management	REST
User Service	        Stores user profile data	                      Internal API
Book Service	        CRUD operations for books	                      REST
Order Service	        Handles orders, cart management	                REST + Events
Review Service	      Manages book reviews and ratings	              REST
Payment Service	      Mock payment processing	                        REST + Events
Notification Service	Sends email confirmations (mocked via console/logs)	Async Events (e.g., RabbitMQ)

üß™ Core Concepts
‚úÖ Full Stack Architecture
- Frontend (React/Next.js): Interface for users to view books, manage cart, place orders, leave reviews.
- Backend (Node.js, Python, or Java): Microservices for domain logic.
- Database: PostgreSQL for core services, MongoDB for reviews (polyglot persistence).
- API Gateway (Optional): For routing requests and central auth.

üê≥ Containerization
- Docker for each microservice.
- Docker Compose for local orchestration.

üîê Authentication
- JWT-based auth handled by Auth Service.
- Middleware on other services to validate JWT and roles.

üßµ Event-Driven Architecture
- RabbitMQ / Kafka for asynchronous communication.
- E.g., When an order is placed, an OrderCreated event is published:
  - Payment Service consumes it and processes payment.
  - Notification Service sends order confirmation.
  - Inventory Service (optional) updates stock.

üîÑ Service-to-Service Communication
- REST: Synchronous (e.g., Book ‚Üí Review).
- Events: Asynchronous (e.g., Order ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Notification).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Suggestions
- Frontend: Angular(mobile) + Blazor(browser)
- Backend: Node.js (Express or NestJS) or Python (FastAPI), Go, asp.Net
- Auth: JWT + bcrypt + Role-based Access Control
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ or Kafka
- Docker & Docker Compose
- API Gateway (Optional): NGINX or Kong
- CI/CD (Optional): GitHub Actions + Docker Hub

üß™ Example Flow (for learning)
- User signs up via Auth Service ‚Üí JWT token issued.
- User browses books ‚Üí Book Service (GET /books)
- User adds book to cart & places order ‚Üí Order Service
- Order Service emits OrderCreated event:
  - Payment Service handles payment.
  - Notification Service sends confirmation.
- User reviews the book ‚Üí Review Service (with Book ID)

üß† Bonus Ideas to Extend
- Add inventory management (StockService)
- Add admin dashboard
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for monitoring
- Add Rate limiting or caching (Redis)
